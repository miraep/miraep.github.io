				<p><strong>The Simpson family</strong> The Simpson family are cartoon characters featured in the animated television series The Simpsons. The Simpsons are a nuclear family consisting of married couple Homer and Marge and their three children Bart, Lisa and Maggie. They live at 742 Evergreen Terrace in the fictional town of Springfield, U.S.A. and they were created by cartoonist Matt Groening who conceived the characters after his own family members, substituting "Bart" for his own name. The family debuted April 19, 1987 in The Tracey Ullman Show short "Good Night" and were later spun off into their own series which debuted on December 17, 1989.<br />Alongside the five main family members, there are a number of other major and minor characters in their family. The most commonly recurring characters are Homer's father Abraham "Grampa" Simpson; Marge's sisters Patty and Selma Bouvier; and the family's two pets, Santa's Little Helper and Snowball II. Other family members include Homer's mother Mona Simpson, Homer's half-brother Herbert Powell, Marge's mother Jacqueline Bouvier, and other minor relatives.</p>
